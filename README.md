</h3>
We introduce WHU-Synthetic, a large-scale 3D synthetic perception dataset designed for multi-task learning, from the initial data augmentation (upsampling and depth completion), through scene understanding (segmentation), to macro-level tasks (place recognition and 3D reconstruction). Collected in the same environmental domain, we ensure inherent alignment across sub-tasks to construct multi-task models without separate training methods. Besides, we implement several novel settings, making it possible to realize certain ideas that are difficult to achieve in real-world scenarios. This supports more adaptive and robust multi-task perception tasks, such as sampling on city-level models, providing point clouds with different densities, and simulating temporal changes.
