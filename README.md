</h3>
End-to-end models capable of handling multiple sub-tasks in parallel have become a new trend, thereby presenting significant challenges and opportunities for the integration of multiple tasks within the domain of 3D vision. The limitations of 3D data acquisition conditions have not only restricted the exploration of many innovative research problems but have also caused existing 3D datasets to predominantly focus on single tasks. This has resulted in a lack of systematic approaches and theoretical frameworks for 3D multi-task learning, with most efforts merely serving as auxiliary support to the primary task. In this paper, we introduce WHU-Synthetic, a large-scale 3D synthetic perception dataset designed for multi-task learning, from the initial data augmentation (upsampling and depth completion), through scene understanding (segmentation), to macro-level tasks (place recognition and 3D reconstruction). Collected in the same environmental domain, we ensure inherent alignment across sub-tasks to construct multi-task models without separate training methods. Besides, we implement several novel settings, making it possible to realize certain ideas that are difficult to achieve in real-world scenarios. This supports more adaptive and robust multi-task perception tasks, such as sampling on city-level models, providing point clouds with different densities, and simulating temporal changes.
